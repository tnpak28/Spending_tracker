## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Xcode 15.0+**
- **iOS 16.0+** target
- **Plaid developer account** (for bank integration)

### 2. Setup Steps

1. **Open the project** in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open SpendingTracker.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Configure Plaid** (for bank integration):
   - Sign up at https://plaid.com/
   - Replace API key in `BankAPIService.swift`
   
3. **Run the app** and start testing features

### 3. Testing Features

#### Voice Input
- Tap the microphone in "Add Expense"
- Say: "I spent 25 dollars on coffee at Starbucks"
- Watch automatic parsing of amount, title, and category

#### Bank Integration
- Use mock data first (built-in)
- Configure real Plaid credentials for live testing

#### Analytics
- Add some expenses to see charts populate
- Switch between different time periods
- View category breakdowns and trends

#### Recurring Detection
- Add similar expenses over time
- Watch the app detect patterns
- Review suggestions for recurring expenses

## 🔧 Architecture Highlights

### MVVM Pattern
- **Clean separation** of concerns
- **Reactive programming** with Combine
- **SwiftUI bindings** for automatic UI updates

### Core Data Integration
- **Local storage** for all expense data
- **Efficient queries** with NSFetchRequest
- **Relationship support** for future features

### Service Layer
- **Modular design** for different integrations
- **Async/await** for modern concurrency
- **Error handling** with proper user feedback

### Advanced Algorithms
- **Levenshtein distance** for text similarity
- **Pattern recognition** for recurring expenses
- **Natural language processing** for voice input

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### User Experience
- **Intuitive navigation** with clear visual hierarchy
- **Quick actions** for common tasks
- **Smart defaults** and suggestions
- **Minimal friction** for data entry

### Data Privacy
- **Local-first** approach
