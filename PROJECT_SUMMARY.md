## 🎙️ Voice Processing Pipeline

```typescript
Voice Input → Speech Recognition → Natural Language Processing → Data Extraction → Form Population

// Processing Steps:
1. Audio capture with platform-native APIs
2. Speech-to-text conversion (local + cloud options)
3. Text parsing for amounts, descriptions, categories
4. Confidence scoring and validation
5. Automatic form filling with user confirmation
```

## 🏦 Hong Kong Banking Integration

### **Supported Banks**
- HSBC Hong Kong
- Bank of China (Hong Kong)
- Standard Chartered Hong Kong
- Hang Seng Bank

### **API Integration Pattern**
```typescript
// OAuth Flow Implementation
1. Authorization URL generation with PKCE
2. User authentication via bank's secure portal
3. Authorization code exchange for access tokens
4. Secure token storage and automatic refresh
5. API calls for accounts, balances, and transactions
```
